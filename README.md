# Title: Python Face Detection Script with OpenCV

# Description:

This script implements real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier. It detects faces from your webcam and displays a rectangle around each detected face.

# Features:

Leverages OpenCV's CascadeClassifier for efficient face detection.
Offers customizable parameters for fine-tuning detection accuracy:
scaleFactor: Controls how much the image is scaled down in each pass (default: 1.1).
minNeighbors: Minimum number of neighboring rectangles to retain a candidate face (default: 5).
minSize: Minimum possible object size (default: (30, 30)).
flags: Additional parameters passed to detectMultiScale (default: cv2.CASCADE_SCALE_IMAGE).
Visualizes detected faces with a green rectangle around them.

# Requirements:

OpenCV library (installation: pip install opencv-python)

# Usage:

Clone or download the repository.
Ensure you have OpenCV installed.
Run the script from your terminal using python face_detection.py.

# Optional:

You can modify the script to:
Save detected faces to images.
Implement facial landmark detection using libraries like MediaPipe (commented out in the provided script).
Integrate with other computer vision tasks like face recognition or emotion detection.
